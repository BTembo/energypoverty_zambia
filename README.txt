The document gives a brief introduction to code used in the energy poverty analysis in Zambia.

- "energypoverty_data.db"  -- has tables: X1, X2, ... , Xn. But it does not 'df_score_sens' and 'df_score_sens2' because these two tables are massive.

- "data_preparation_energypovertyZambia.R" -- gives steps that were taken to prepare the data.

- "sens_data_generation_energypovertyZambia.R" -- gives steps taken to generate and prepare the sensivity data. This was used to test the impacts of cut-off and weights on 'Incidence', 'Intensity' and 'MEPI'.

- "sens_data_generation_energypovertyZambia.R" -- the is the main analysis script for the energy poverty analysis.

- "plots_energypovertyZambia.R" -- gives the code for all the plots and figures created for the paper.

- "tables_energypovertyZambia.R" -- gives the code for all the tables created for the paper.
